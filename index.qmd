::: {#hero-heading}
I'm an assistant professor in the [Department of Public Management and Policy](https://aysps.gsu.edu/public-management-policy/) at the [Andrew Young School of Policy Studies](https://aysps.gsu.edu/) at [Georgia State University](https://www.gsu.edu/). I received a PhD in public policy and political science from Duke University's [Sanford School of Public Policy](http://sanford.duke.edu/) in 2017.

I study [how international NGOs work in authoritarian countries](https://www.ingoresearch.org/amicable-contempt/), and I received the 2016–2018 [Emerging Scholar Dissertation Award](https://www.istr.org/page/DissertationISTR) from the [International Society for Third Sector Research (ISTR)](https://www.istr.org/). I do research in public administration and policy, nonprofit management, international relations, and comparative politics.

I teach courses on [program evaluation and causal inference](https://evalf22.classes.andrewheiss.com/), [statistics and data science](https://statsf18.classes.andrewheiss.com/), [data visualization](https://datavizs22.classes.andrewheiss.com/), [economics](https://econs22.classes.andrewheiss.com/), and [science communication](https://storiesf17.classes.andrewheiss.com/). I'm also a [certified RStudio instructor](https://education.rstudio.com/trainers/people/heiss+andrew/) and a [Posit Academy mentor](https://posit.co/products/enterprise/academy/) and absolutely love teaching how to use [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and [the tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/).
